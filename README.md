# TopJobPosting
TopJobPosting is a collection of templates for job postings and job listing pages for various clients in the healthcare industry. 

## Target Group for this project
**Implementation managers of internet job boards**

The templates are based on a common codebase for HTML5, CSS, and scripts. Adjustments have been made to meet the CI/CD requirements of each brand with reasonable effort. The layout of the templates is designed to be mobile-first and fluid. Internet Explorer is not supported anymore
The underlying data structure is consistent for all clients/brands and is provided in XML format, which also includes the metadata of individual job postings.

Tracking code is not currently included in the templates. If it is added later, its implementation will be mandatory up to and including the customer's device.

We welcome any insights and experiences with operating systems and browser versions, which can be reported here.
