# TopJobPosting
**Objective and Purpose**  
Job postings of the public hospital network of the canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland, follow a uniform structure.  
Job boards that reproduce these job postings on their own platforms or third-party platforms shall use the information of this project "TopJobPosting" to reproduce their ads.

**Target Audience**  
The content of these pages is aimed at implementation managers. Knowledge of HTTP, XML, XSLT, HTML, and CSS is expected.

# Job Advertisement
The template files for the job advertisement postings can be found in the [/docs](docs) directory. They represent the expected result.
The previews contain sample job advertisements. Note that the external links in examples may not work due to their example nature.
